## üìù Questions & Answers

### 1. What is the difference between `getElementById`, `getElementsByClassName`, and `querySelector` / `querySelectorAll`?

- **getElementById** ‚Üí Selects a specific element using its `id`. Always returns a single element.  
- **getElementsByClassName** ‚Üí Selects all elements with the same class name. Returns an **HTMLCollection** (array-like).  
- **querySelector** ‚Üí Selects the first element that matches a **CSS selector**. Returns a single element.  
- **querySelectorAll** ‚Üí Selects all elements that match a **CSS selector**. Returns a **NodeList**.

### 2. How do you create and insert a new element into the DOM?

```javascript
// Create a new element
const newDiv = document.createElement("div");

// Add some content
newDiv.textContent = "Hello World!";

// Append to the DOM
document.body.appendChild(newDiv);
````

This way, we can create a new element and add it to the webpage.

### 3. What is Event Bubbling and how does it work?

Event Bubbling means when an event (e.g., `click`) occurs on an element, it first triggers on that element, then propagates upward ‚Üí parent ‚Üí grandparent ‚Üí document.

**Example:**
If a button is inside a `div`, and both have click listeners, clicking the button will trigger events in this order:
`button ‚Üí div ‚Üí body ‚Üí document`.

### 4. What is Event Delegation in JavaScript? Why is it useful?

Event Delegation means attaching an event listener to a **parent element** to handle events on its **child elements**.

‚úÖ **Advantages:**

* No need to add separate listeners to each child.
* It works for dynamically added elements (added later to the DOM).

### 5. What is the difference between `preventDefault()` and `stopPropagation()` methods?

* **preventDefault()** ‚Üí Stops the browser‚Äôs default behavior.
  Example: Prevent a form from reloading the page on submit.

* **stopPropagation()** ‚Üí Stops the event from propagating (bubbling or capturing) to parent elements.
